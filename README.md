# OOP3 
This is the extended second project of the OOP course 
This project represent a weighted, directed graph as an Interactive game . 
The graph is built from two main objects - Node and Edge
The game has two main characters- Robots and Fruits
the aim of the game if to collect as much food as the robots can traversing through the graph. 
The player has two options- manual game where he can move the robots by himselfm and a automatic game where the game uses couple algorithms like - BFS Algorithm , Dijkstra Algorithm and more to to move and make calculations on the graph.
